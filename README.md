## üéØ Key Features Deep Dive

### Beneficiary System
- Automatic customer info population
- Service-specific duplicate detection
- Quick selection for repeat transactions
- Persistent storage across app sessions

### Security Features
- PIN requirement for app access
- Biometric unlock support
- Automatic session timeout
- Secure credential storage

#### Inactivity Lock
If the app stays in the background or inactive state for 5 minutes or longer, the session is automatically re-locked. On returning to the app the user is redirected to the unlock screen (`/auth/app-unlock`) and must re-enter their PIN (or biometrics if enabled). The last background timestamp is persisted using SecureStore so even if the OS kills the app while backgrounded, the inactivity period is still enforced on next launch. Adjust the timeout by changing `INACTIVITY_LOCK_MS` in `app/_layout.tsx`.

### Smart UX
- Network auto-detection for VTU services
- Skeleton loading screens
- Pull-to-refresh functionality
- Haptic feedback integration
